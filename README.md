Simple Vulkan example in Slang
==============================

# TODO REPLACE slang-cpu-utils REMOTE WITH https version!!!!

This example program is fully written in Slang. This means that in addition
to the shaders, the CPU code is also in Slang. The demo loads a compute shader
and displays a simple animation.

This is not a good example for learning Vulkan or programming shaders with
Slang; it's specifically a demo of using Slang on CPU.

For background on how this works, please read [slang-cpu-utils/README.md](https://github.com/juliusikkala/slang-cpu-utils/blob/main/README.md).
